        Hello Everyone! My name is Andre Hernandez, I am 26 years old, and I am
        from Mexico City, Mexico but I moved to the United States 5 years ago. I
        am currently living in Vineyard Utah with my wife Stephanie and our son
        Leo.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a self-taught Front-end developer majoring in Applied Technology, I
        started programming a year ago and I have enjoyed every part of it, even
        debugging :)
      </p>
      <p>
        My hubbies are all around sports, whenever i have free time i like to
        play soccer or watch basketball and football. This is one of my favrite
        seassons of the year because we have NFL play-offs, Super Bowl, and NBA
        All-Stars Weekend, which I am really excited because this year is going
        to be here in SLC Utah!
